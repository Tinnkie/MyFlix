# myFlix Server-Side

### This project is the server-side component of a web application that provides users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users can sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

<br>

## Objective

### The objective of this project is to create a well-designed REST API and architected database using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The API will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST, and CRUD methods will be used to retrieve data from the database and store it in a non-relational way.

<br>

## Essential Views & Features

1. Return a list of ALL movies to the user
2. Return data (description, genre, director, image URL, whether it's featured or not) about a single movie by title to the user
3. Return data about a genre (description) by name/title (e.g., "Thriller")
4. Return data about a director (bio, birth year, death year) by name
5. Allow new users to register
6. Allow users to update their user info (username, password, email, date of birth)
7. Allow users to add a movie to their list of favorites
8. Allow users to remove a movie from their list of favorites
9. Allow existing users to deregister
